# Hopfield Neural Network

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a Hopfield Neural Network. It includes code for creating, training, and testing the network, along with a Jupyter Notebook that explains the basic concepts and demonstrates the functionality of the network step by step.

Hopfield networks are a type of recurrent neural network that serve as content-addressable memory systems with binary threshold nodes. They are often used for pattern recognition and optimization tasks.

## Features

- **Jupyter Notebook**: A step-by-step tutorial explaining Hopfield networks and demonstrating the code functionality.
- **Code Implementation**: A Python implementation of the Hopfield network.
- **Examples**: Use cases showcasing pattern recognition and memory retrieval.
- **Insights into Hopfield Networks**: Print weights, follow Hopfield network dynamics, and calculate energy for deeper understanding.

## Files

- `hopfield.py`: The main Python script containing utility functions and the primary class `HopfieldNetwork`.
- `hopfield_network.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that explains the basic theory and demonstrates the usage of the Hopfield network.

## Prerequisites

To use this repository, you need Python 3.7 or higher and the following Python packages:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib` (for visualizations in the notebook)
- `seaborn` (for advanced visualizations in the notebook)
- `csv` (for data handling in examples or input files)

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LLapsus/hopfield.git
cd hopfield
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook hopfield_network.ipynb
```

3. Run the notebook cells to explore the implementation and functionality.

## Usage

The Hopfield network can be used for:

- Storing and retrieving binary patterns.
- Demonstrating associative memory.

The `hopfield_network.ipynb` notebook provides detailed examples to get you started.

## Theory

Hopfield networks are inspired by the human brain's associative memory system. They use an energy minimization principle to converge to a stored pattern. For more details, refer to the Jupyter Notebook, which explains:

- The basic structure of a Hopfield network.
- The learning rule (Hebbian learning).
- How the network retrieves stored patterns.
